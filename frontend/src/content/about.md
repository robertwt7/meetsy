## **About**

Meetsy is a scheduling system where you can create a set of available times and invite your friend / colleague to book one of your time. We leverage the power of the Google Calendar API to allow you to create a calendar and invite your friends / colleagues to book your time. The reason why we are using Google API is to allow us to create the accepted event on your behalf in your calendar, further we also show your existing events in our app to make it easier for you to schedule your time.

We are [open source](https://github.com/robertwt7/meetsy), and can be seen as a Calendly alternatives.
