## **Terms of Use.**

**Effective June 29, 2021**

Thanks for using Meetsy. These Terms of Use (“Terms” or “Agreement”) are a legal agreement between you and Meetsy (“Meetsy,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) and govern your use of all the text, data, information, software, graphics, photographs and more that we and our affiliates may make available to you (all of which we refer to as “Documentation”), including our websites and any services, plug-ins, software or other Downloadable Tools (as defined below) that we may provide through any of our websites (the “Platform” or “Website” and together with the Materials, these “Service(s)”). Meetsy “Users” are the people who have created a Meetsy account (also referred to as “Customer(s)”), and Meetsy “Invitees” are people who have scheduled a meeting with a Meetsy User but may or may not have registered with Meetsy. A Meetsy “Viewer” is a person who visits the Meetsy Website but may or may not be a Meetsy User or Meetsy Invitee.

If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company or other organization, you hereby represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into these Terms on behalf of such company or other organization (“Authorized User”).

READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE BROWSING THIS WEBSITE. USING THESE SERVICES INDICATES THAT YOU HAVE BOTH READ AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS. YOU CANNOT USE THESE SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS. THESE TERMS CONTAIN A DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION PROVISION, INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS AND WITH RESPECT TO DISPUTES YOU MAY HAVE WITH MEETSY.

When using the features of the Services you are subject to any agreements, policies or guidelines applicable to such features that may be posted from time to time.

## **General Use.**

We invite you to use these Services for your individual purposes and not for the purposes of reselling ("Permitted Purposes") – enjoy!

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use and to display the Documentation and a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to access and use the Service following the set-up of a Free Account or Paid Account as set forth below.

Our Service is not intended for and may not be used by individuals under 13 years of age. By registering for a Meetsy account, you state that you are at least 18 years of age, and you are responsible for ensuring that all Meetsy Users and Invitees are at least 13 years old.

## **Account Setup.**

To use the Website, you need to set up a Meetsy account. Meetsy reserves the right to terminate any accounts not in use or deemed fraudulent.

When you create an account, we collect registration-related information, which includes your email address and your name. Once you submit the required registration information, we alone will determine whether or not to approve your proposed account. If approved, you agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information that can be accomplished by logging into your account and making relevant changes directly. You are responsible for complying with these Terms when you access this Website, whether directly or through any account that you may set up through or on this Website. Because it is your account, it is your job to obtain and maintain all equipment and services needed for access to and use of this Website as well as paying related charges. You agree to choose a strong and secure password(s) and maintain the confidentiality of your password(s), including any password of a third-party site that we may allow you to use to access this Website. Should you believe your password or security for this Website has been breached in any way, you must immediately notify us at hello@meetsy.xyz.

Your account belongs to you. However, Meetsy controls the URL(s) assigned to your account and may change or deactivate the URL(s) without prior notice.

Meetsy reserves the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of our Terms and to take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to canceling your User account, reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any information necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profile, e-mail addresses, usage history, posted materials, IP addresses, and traffic information, as allowed under our P**rivacy policy**. You agree to promptly notify Meetsy in the event that you are made aware of any unauthorized or illegal use of the Website.

## **Intellectual Property.**

Our Services may contain our service marks or trademarks as well as those of our affiliates or other companies, in the form of words, graphics, and logos, and any and all intellectual property provided to Customer or any Authorized User in connection with the Services (“Meetsy IP”). Your use of our Services does not constitute any right or license for you to use such service marks/trademarks. Our Website is also protected under international copyright laws. The copying, redistribution, use, or publication by you of any portion of our Website is strictly prohibited. Your use of our Services do not grant you ownership rights of any kind in our Website or Materials. Meetsy reserves all rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to Customer or any third party any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to the Meetsy IP.

## **Notices and Messages.**

By using the Services, you consent to receive emails from us. These emails may include notices about applicable fees and charges, transactional information and other information concerning or related to the Services. These emails are part of your relationship with us. By scheduling a meeting as an Invitee with a Meetsy User, you consent to receive transactional emails related to the scheduled meeting (e.g. booking confirmations and reminders). If, as an Invitee, you provide your phone number for text notifications, you also consent to receive SMS notifications from Meetsy related to the scheduled meeting between you and the Meetsy User.

You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. You agree to keep your contact information up to date, and to monitor your email settings to ensure that you receive emails from us at your discretion and as necessary.

## **General Terms.**

We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you. We may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s) if possible. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this Website without prior notice to you.

The rights of Meetsy under our Terms will survive the termination of this Agreement. No additional terms, conditions, consent, waiver, alteration, or modification shall be binding unless in writing and signed by both parties. Acceptance of any order by Meetsy is expressly limited to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any proposed additional or inconsistent terms or conditions, including those in or accompanying any Customer proposal, any Customer purchase order, or other agreement or any other Customer document issued in connection with the sale or delivery of Products or Services is deemed by Meetsy to be a material change and is objected to and rejected by Meetsy. Meetsy’s acceptance of any orders will not constitute acceptance of any terms and conditions contained therein.

In no event shall Meetsy be liable to Customer, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement, if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond Meetsy’s reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, epidemics, contractor difficulties, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.

Unless Customer has specifically notified Meetsy to the contrary in writing (including via email to hello@meetsy.xyz), Meetsy may disclose your company as a customer of Meetsy (if you use Meetsy for business purposes and/or use a business email address as your Meetsy User email address) and may use your company’s name and logo on the Website and in Meetsy’s promotional content in accordance with Customer’s brand guidelines or related documentation if provided by Customer. Meetsy will be granted a revocable, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, royalty-free right and license (the "Trademark License") to use, display and reproduce such party's name, logo, trademarks and service marks (the "Trademarks"). Both acknowledge that the other party's Trademark is and will remain the exclusive property of such party.

## **Changes.**

We may amend our Terms at any time by publishing revised Terms on our Website and/or by sending an email to the address you gave us. These Terms are current as of the Effective Date set forth above. If any changes are made to these Terms, we’ll post them on this page, so please be sure to check back periodically. If you continue to use Meetsy after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised Terms. Therefore, it is important for you to periodically review our Terms to make sure you still agree to them. If you object to any such modifications, your sole recourse will be to cease using this Website. Meetsy reserves the right to change any and all features of our Services, at any time, without notice.
