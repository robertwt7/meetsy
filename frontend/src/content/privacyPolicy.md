## **Information We Collect.**

We collect information about you directly from you and automatically through your use of our Website. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources.

In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Website. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date, and time.

## **Information You Provide Voluntarily.**

Meetsy collects the following information, either directly from Meetsy Users, Invitees, or Viewers, or through third-parties regarding Users, Invitees, or Viewers.

## **Appointment Information.**

A Meetsy User, Invitee, or a third-party may voluntarily give us certain information. This can include names, email addresses, and phone numbers; email addresses of other people; the subject of the meeting; and any other information provided to us or as required by the Meetsy User upon scheduling, pursuant to the Meetsy Terms of Use. If you receive an invitation from a Meetsy User but do not wish to become a Meetsy User, please contact the Meetsy User who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.

## **Calendar Information.**

A Meetsy User may connect their calendar with Meetsy. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store who you are meeting with, their email address, the meeting title, or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.

## **Information Collected Automatically.**
